// Task 2 lands the process boundary before Tasks 3-7 build compute, publish and the worker loop on
// top of it, so every item here has a test caller and no production one — and `scripts/gates.sh`
// runs `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` over this crate, which compiles the bin target
// without `cfg(test)` and so turns each of those into an error.

// **Task 7 must delete this attribute** — it spawns the worker, which is what gives this module its
// first production caller — then fix what the compiler reports rather than putting it back: anything
// still dead once a caller exists is dead for a reason worth reading. Naming the task rather than
// the condition is deliberate: a condition is not greppable and nobody is watching for it. If one
// item genuinely has no caller yet, narrow it to an
// `#[allow(dead_code)]` on that item carrying the reason — do not keep the blanket. `vcs.rs:17-30`
